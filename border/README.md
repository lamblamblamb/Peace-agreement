# Assignment 3 

My part of the assignment 3 is to analyze the connection between border issues and natural resource issues according to the "peace agreement.xlsx" by histogram.



## Step 1 

* Filter the natural resource related agreements out.
* Show it by country with peace agreement counts.



The result is shown as follow:

* Use the above method to analyze the natural resource related agreements in the new area and draw it.



The result is shown as follow:
