# Assignment 3 

My part of the assignment 3 is to analyze the connection between border issues and natural resource issues according to the "peace agreement.xlsx" by histogram.



## Step 1 

Our motion is to find out the connection between border and natural resource, so the first step is that to filter out the peace agreements in our dataset refer to conflicts over natural resources. The specific steps shown as follow:

* Filter the natural resource related agreements out.
* Show it by country with peace agreement counts.



The result is shown as follow:

## Step 2 Africa(excl MENA)

From the assignment 2 result and the above result, we can see that Afirca(excl MENA) is the most worthwhile area to analyze the connection between border and natural resource. So we do the steps as follows:

* Reduce the analysis area to Africa(excl MENA)

* Use the above method to analyze the natural resource related agreements in the new area and draw it.



The result is shown as follow:

(Just the area of Africa(excl MENA))



## Step 3

Q: How can we draw the conclusion of the difference between the origin data and natural resource related over Africa(excl MENA)? 

A: maybe use the histogram to show the difference between the origin data of Africa(excl MENA) and the data of natural resource related according to the number of peace agreements.



The result is shown as follow:
